## Summary

The **Fairphone Clock Widget** was the default clock in official Android 5 OSes for the Fairphone 2 smartphone, both Fairphone OS and [Fairphone Open][fairphone-open].

It's just a regular clock widget. It doesn't include other Fairphone 2 [goodies][fairphone2-features] like battery estimation, "Your Fairphone for..." or Peace of Mind info, for the moment.

Fairphone stopped the development of some Fairphone-specific apps when the Fairphone 2 was updated to Android 6 "Marshmallow". Since they are open source, the [WeAreFairphone community][wearefairphone] make them available for those users who want to keep the original [Fairphone experience][fairphone-experience].

You may want to take a look at Fairphone's [Recent Contacts][wearefairphone-mycontacts] widget and [Fairphone Launcher 3][wearefairphone-launcher] too.
